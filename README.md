create an application which helps them calculate which size of 
pizza is best for group bookings.

The application must let the user enter:

● The number of people in the group (1 to 999,999,999)

● How many pieces each person will eat (1 - 10 pieces). 
(This will give a total number of pieces.)

They have 5 sizes of Pizza which their customers can order.

5 inch $3 4 pieces

7 inch $5 6 pieces

10 inch $8 10 pieces

15 inch $12 15 pieces

24 inch $18 24 pieces

Create a program that will calculate how much the cost would be for each size of pizza, and 
therefore which is the lowest cost for the customer
